This is (or, rather, will be) a game for the Pattonville High School chapter of the Technology Student Association.
It is a fantasy platformer written in Godot and will be sumbitted in the _Video Game Design_ category.

## Category Description

"Participants design, build, and launch an E-rated online video game—with accompanying required documentation—that addresses the annual theme.
Semifinalists participate in an interview to demonstrate the knowledge and expertise they gained during the development of the game."[^1]

### Prompt/Theme

"Fantasy Adventure game"[^2]

## Details

Wizards in Calculus is a high-phantasy adventure platformer with a twist. What twist? Math!
Players use basic geometry theorems to "power-up" and make their way through this world.
All the while, they're learning! Hurrah!
